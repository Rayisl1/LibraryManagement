# 📚 Library Management System (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple **Library Management System** implemented in **Java**.  
It was created as part of **Assignment 1** to demonstrate basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, methods, encapsulation, and object comparison.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice object-oriented programming in Java
- Create multiple related classes
- Use constructors, methods, getters, and setters
- Create objects in the `main` method
- Output object information to the console
- Compare objects using the `equals()` method
